# VITS-VC

VITS method adopts variational inference augmented with normalizing flows and an adversarial training process, which improves the expressive power of generative modeling

Train VITS example [link](https://github.com/AraKchrUser/tts_vits_fine_tune/tree/main)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits.git
pip install -r vits/requirements.txt
python VITS/vae_vc.py
```
